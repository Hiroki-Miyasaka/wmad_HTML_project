                    Abstract art, non-figurative art, non-objective art, and non-representational art, are closely related terms. They are similar, but perhaps not of identical meaning.
                    Abstraction indicates a departure from reality in depiction of imagery in art. This departure from accurate representation can be slight, partial, or complete. Abstraction exists 
                    along a continuum. Even art that aims for verisimilitude of the highest degree can be said to be Abstract, at least theoretically, since perfect representation is impossible. Artwork 
                    which takes liberties, altering for instance color and form in ways that are conspicuous, can be said to be partially Abstract. Total Abstraction bears no trace of any reference to 
                    anything recognizable. In geometric Abstraction, for instance, one is unlikely to find references to naturalistic entities. Figurative art and total Abstraction are almost mutually 
                    exclusive. But figurative and representational (or realistic) art often contain partial Abstraction.
