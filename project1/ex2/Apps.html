                I have never shared my suite of essential apps before, so here it is. As I have multiple devices running different 
                operating systems(Android, iOS, macOS, Windows), I give a first priority to apps with cross-platform support.

                <p>
                    Google Keep: For quick notes, shopping lists for the day, and short notes I want to keep handy. It employs 
                    Material You design which looks nice on my Pixel 5. My notes are synchronised and accessible on all my 
                    devices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Notability: For written notes, scribbles, language learning, meeting notes. My notes are backed up to Google 
                    Drive.The only downside is that the app is available only on iOS and macOS.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Notion: For serious notes, travel plans, wikis, learning, notes that need text formatting. Notion is very powerful 
                    at being a database and creating interactive notes. I can also collaborate with friends when planning a trip.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    Standard Notes: For plain text notes. I like the simplicity and the sense of privacy and security that Standard 
                    Notes offers. Notes are encrypted end-to-end and you can also lock the app with different passcodes on each 
                    device. More features can be added (on paid plans) through extensions.
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    TickTick: For to-do lists. I can organise tasks into lists, assign a priority, repeat occurrences, add tags, add 
                    subtasks, and do habit checks. The app is simple, lightweight, and works fast on all my devices.
