                Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
                Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology 
                comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has 
                since been featured in films, television shows, video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias 
                of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his 
                parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal 
                with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting 
                characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests 
                Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green 
                Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, he gets spider-related abilities from a bite from a 
                radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and 
                detecting danger with his "spider-sense."
