                Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
                Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology 
                comic book Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has 
                since been featured in films, television shows, video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias 
                of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his 
                parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal 
                with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him many supporting 
                characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic interests 
                Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green 
                Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, he gets spider-related abilities from a bite from a 
                radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and 
                detecting danger with his "spider-sense."

                n 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was casting 
                about for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand for 
                comic books, and the desire to create a character with whom teens could identify.  As with Fantastic Four, 
                Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of his system" what he felt was missing in comic books.

                In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a great 
                influenceand in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was further inspired by seeing a spider 
                climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become unsure of 
                whether or not this is true.Although at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending 
                with "boy", Lee says he chose "Spider-Man" because he wanted the character to age as the series progressed, 
                and moreover felt the name "Spider-Boy" would have made the character sound inferior to other superheroes.
                He also decided to insert a hyphen in the name, as he felt it looked too similar to Superman, another superhero 
                with a red and blue costume which starts with an "S" and ends with "man" .

                Sally Kempton for the Village Voice opined in 1965 that "Spider-Man has a terrible identity problem, a marked inferiority complex, and a fear of women. He is anti-social, [sic] castration-ridden, racked with 
                Oedipal guilt, and accident-prone ... [a] functioning neurotic".Agonizing over his choices, always attempting to do right, he is nonetheless viewed with suspicion by the authorities, who seem unsure as to 
                whether he is a helpful vigilante or a clever criminal.
                Notes cultural historian Bradford W. Wright,
            </p>
            <p class="personality_and_themes_explain_position2">
                Spider-Man's plight was to be misunderstood and persecuted by the very public that he swore to protect. In the first issue of The Amazing Spider-Man, J. Jonah Jameson, publisher of the Daily Bugle, 
                launches an editorial campaign against the "Spider-Man menace." The resulting negative publicity exacerbates popular suspicions about the mysterious Spider-Man and makes it impossible for him to 
                earn any more money by performing. Eventually, the bad press leads the authorities to brand him an outlaw. Ironically, Peter finally lands a job as a photographer for Jameson's Daily Bugle.

                The mid-1960s stories reflect the political tensions of the time. Early 1960s Marvel stories often deal with the Cold War and Communism.As Wright observes,

            <p class="personality_and_themes_explain_position4">
                From his high-school beginnings to his entry into college life, Spider-Man remained the superhero most relevant to the world of young people. Fittingly, then, his comic book also contained some of 
                the earliest references to the politics of young people. In 1968, in the wake of actual militant student demonstrations at Columbia University, Peter Parker finds himself in the midst of similar unrest at 
                his Empire State University.... Peter has to reconcile his natural sympathy for the students with his assumed obligation to combat lawlessness as Spider-Man. As a law-upholding liberal, he finds 
                himself caught between militant leftism and angry conservatives.
